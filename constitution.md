## Article 6. Executive Committee Members

### 6.1 Elections and terms

General elections shall be organised every year under the responsibility of the Executive Committee. Election results become effective from the start of the calendar year following the elections. Officers (Secretary, Treasurer and Representatives) shall be elected directly from the membership for terms of two years. The Executive Committee Chair is elected directly from the membership, serves as Deputy Chair for two years, and then serves as Chair in the following two years, as described in Article 6.2. Terms in the Executive Committee shall be staggered, such that approximately half of the positions are elected each year.

### 6.2 Executive Committee Chair and Deputy Chair

The Executive Committee Chair is elected directly from the membership and commits to a total of four years of service.  A newly elected Chair serves first as Deputy Chair for two years, and then succeeds to become Chair for the following two years. Upon completion of both terms, the Chair can opt to remain as a member of the Executive Committee for an additional two years as a TDWG representative. 

If an Executive Committee Chair resigns or otherwise becomes unable to fulfil the role, the Deputy Chair shall become Chair, and a new Deputy Chair shall be elected in the next general election.  In the event that both a Chair and Deputy Chair become unable to serve, the Executive Committee shall appoint one of the current TDWG officers to serve as Acting Chair, and both Chair and Deputy Chair shall be elected the next general election.

#### 6.2.1 Executive Committee Chair responsibilities

Presides at meetings of TDWG and at meetings of the Executive Committee; convenes Executive Committee meetings; is entitled to sign jointly with one other officer on behalf of TDWG; enacts such functions as are assigned by the Executive Committee; represents TDWG at external meetings; delegates on an ad-hoc basis the above responsibilities to other Executive Committee members.

The Treasurer is entitled to sign jointly with one other officer on behalf of TDWG; maintains the membership list; reports finances annually to the membership; collects membership dues and other TDWG income; maintains the financial documents and accounts of TDWG; administers the assets of TDWG in conformance with instructions from the Executive Committee.

### 6.5 Chairs of functional subcommittees

Chairs of Functional Subcommittees (see Article 7) participate, ex officio, as full members of the Executive Committee. They liaise between their subcommittees and the TDWG Executive Committee, summarise activities, and discuss strategic priorities and future plans in regards to subcommittee responsibilities.  

### 6.6 Elected Representatives

To encourage balanced representation one representative will be elected from each of the following regions: Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, North America, and Oceania. 

## Article 7. Functional Subcommittees

### 7.1 Definition, role and scope 

Functional Subcommittees (FS) are committees operating under specific mandates, set by the Executive Committee in response to identified needs of TDWG. The overarching role of a FS is to assist the Executive Committee in its standing tasks. FS operate under charters prepared and approved by the Executive Committee, following consultation with the membership.   

### 7.2. Establishment, duration and dissolution

The scope and mode of operations for each Functional Subcommittee are defined by their published charters. Following approval by the Executive as in Paragraph 7.1, a FS is established and fully effective at the moment of election of its chairperson. FS charters shall be presented to the membership for open consultation for at least 21 days prior to approval by the Executive. Following the Executive Committee’s decision to dissolve a FS, it remains effective until the end of the FS chairperson’s term of duty, as defined in Paragraph 7.3.

### 7.3 Functional subcommittee membership and leadership

The chair of each FS is elected during the TDWG general elections. FS chairs are elected for two full calendar years. FS chairs are responsible for appointing a deputy-chair with attending and no voting rights at Executive Committee meetings. FS chairs invite members and manage membership in their respective committees. Each committee shall operate with more than three and fewer than 15 members. In case of resignation of a FS chair, the deputy chair will be invited to take the place of the chair until the next general elections and a new deputy is appointed.

## Article 8. Assets

The revenue of TDWG shall consist of membership dues, sales of publications, lease of rights, grants, gifts and bequests, income from investments, and any other kinds of income compatible with the aims of TDWG.

The assets of TDWG shall be used exclusively for the statutory aims and purposes, and in no case to the immediate profit of its members.

The financial year shall be the calendar year.

## Article 9. Amendments

Alterations to the Constitution may be proposed by the Executive Committee, or may be submitted in writing to the Executive Committee by either at least five individual members from at least two countries, or at least three institutional members from at least two countries. The proposed alteration must be published and the membership notified at least ninety days before close of voting. To be accepted, the proposed alteration must receive simple majorities of affirmative votes from both individual members and institutional members.

The Executive Committee may propose that by-laws be established, altered, or repealed. The by-laws proposal must be published and the membership notified at least thirty days before the close of voting. To be adopted, the proposal must receive simple majorities of affirmative votes from both individual and institutional members.

## Article 10. Dissolution

Dissolution of TDWG can only be enacted by a two-thirds majority of both individual and institutional members by vote. A proposal of dissolution must be dispatched by the Executive Committee to the membership at least ninety days before close of voting.

Upon the dissolution of TDWG, any net remaining assets shall be transferred to the International Association for Plant Taxonomy or its successor.

## Article 11. Voting

TDWG shall strive to make decisions based on broad consensus rather than simple majority. The Executive Committee may assess consensus through mechanisms other than voting, such as solicited reviews and public requests for comment, except where voting is mandated elsewhere in this Constitution. If a broad consensus cannot be reached, the Executive Committee may arrange for an issue to be decided by a vote of the membership.

In general elections of officers, each current member will be entitled to one vote, but may abstain.  On counting, each institutional vote will be weighted using the current fees-based multiplier and the candidate receiving a plurality of the totalled votes shall be appointed to the office (see Article 5, item 6). 

In questions of governance and other issues requiring a simple decision to accept or reject a proposal, the votes of Individual and Institutional members will be tallied separately, without weighting, and a proposal will pass if it receives a simple majority of the votes cast in each membership category.

The Executive Committee shall specify the schedule and mechanism(s) for making nominations for elected positions and casting votes. Any voting procedure should afford each member an opportunity to vote in an expedient manner and should not unduly delay decision making. The Secretary shall authenticate, tally, and publish voting results within a reasonable timeframe.
