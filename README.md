# TDWG Constitution

This repository now contains the official version of the [TDWG Constitution](constitution.md).

A new version has been proposed by the TDWG Executive Committee.  The new version was posted on [tdwg.org] as a (http://www.tdwg.org/about-tdwg/new-constitution/](package (PDF)) 6 Sep 2016, which opened the public comment period.  Please note, the [final version is posted here](constitution/revised-proposal.md) and supercedes the version that opened public comment (6 September).

## The origins of proposed changes

In 2015 The TDWG Executive Committee commissioned a team of TDWG members to propose changes that would:  
- improve operational effectiveness of the Executive Committee  
- improve the level of engagement of TDWG membership in driving key parts of the organisation  
- improve the capacity of the Executive Committee to address complex and diverse issues.  

In parallel, consultants were enlisted to help us prepare TDWG's application for non-profit status in the United States.  Our consultants identified things that needed to be added to make TDWG comply as a non-profit organization.  Those changes were finalized 10 November and incorporated into the final proposed version.  These changes were deemed necessary, but render the package of 6 September obsolete.
